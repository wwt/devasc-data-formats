# DEVASC Data Encoding Formats Hands-On

## Overview

This repo has several guided, hands-on exercises which will help you learn and practice how to use various data encoding formats with Python.  These exercises compliment the *Data Encoding Formats* presentation which is available in the Study Group files repository.

The **Lab Setup** section has step-by-step directions to help you deploy the learning materials using [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) within the [WWT Programmability Foundations Lab](https://www.wwt.com/lab/programmability-foundations-lab).

\*\* Note - this lab requires that you have a **GitHub *Personal Access Token (PAT)*** available with ***repo*** scope permissions \*\*

* You will authenticate to GitHub using your standard GitHub username and substitute your PAT for your password.
* Directions to setup a PAT are here -  [GitHub Personal Access Token Setup](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
* If you are a WWT employee, be sure to **enable SSO** for your PAT.
