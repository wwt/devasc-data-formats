    "## Overview\n",
    "This first exercise will help familiarize you with the lab environment and set you up to work with different types of structured data in subsequent exercises.  All of the code you need for this particular exercise is already in the code blocks below, with the intent to provide you with both a learning aide and reference material.  The remaining exercises will progressively require you to write more of your own code and answer keys are available in case you get stuck and to help you check your work.  Of course, there are many 'right' ways to create code that gets the job done so your code doesn't have to exactly match the answer keys.  This exercise will familiarize you with:\n",
    "1. Interacting with the local file system.\n",
    "2. Writing and reading from text files.\n",
    "3. Creating and manipulating lists.\n",
    "4. Using a loop to create a dictionary with list data.\n",
    "5. Displaying Python objects in a friendly format.\n"
