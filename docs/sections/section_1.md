# Getting Started With The Lab

## :fontawesome-solid-flask: Lab Overview

The lab environment runs in a Docker Container which hosts a web-based, interactive Python environment called [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html "JupyterLab Overview & User Guide"){target=_blank}.  The JupyterLab server will allow you to work through a series of Python-based, **data encoding formats** exercises using your web browser.

### :fontawesome-brands-docker: Lab Requirements

You only need a few things to start working through the labs:

1. A Docker runtime environment.

    - [Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop "Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS"){target=_blank}, [Docker for Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search?offering=community&operating_system=linux&q=&type=edition "Docker for Linux"){target=_blank}, etc.

2. A web browser with [JupyterLab support](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#supported-browsers "JupyterLab Supported Browsers"){target=_blank}.

You may run the lab Docker Container in either the [WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab](https://www.wwt.com/lab/programmability-foundations-lab "WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab"){target=_blank} or in your own Docker environment.
