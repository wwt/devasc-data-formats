# Getting Started With The Lab

## :fontawesome-solid-flask: Lab Overview

The lab environment runs in a Docker Container which hosts a web-based, interactive Python environment called [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html "JupyterLab Overview & User Guide"){target=_blank}.  The JupyterLab server will allow you to work through a series of Python-based, **data encoding formats** exercises using your web browser.

---

### :fontawesome-brands-docker: Lab Requirements

You only need a few things to start working through the labs:

1. A Docker runtime environment.

    - [Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop "Docker Desktop for Windows or macOS"){target=_blank}, [Docker for Linux](https://hub.docker.com/search?offering=community&operating_system=linux&q=&type=edition "Docker for Linux"){target=_blank}, etc.

2. A web browser with [JupyterLab support](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#supported-browsers "JupyterLab Supported Browsers"){target=_blank}.

## :material-beaker: Lab Setup Instructions

We provide instructions for three different lab setup options.  Choose the option that best suits your needs and then follow the step-by-step directions:

???+ abstract "Lab Setup Options"

    1. :fontawesome-solid-laptop-code: **Auto-provision the environment in the [WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab](https://www.wwt.com/lab/programmability-foundations-lab "WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab"){target=_blank}.**
        - The best chioce if you don't have a place to install and run Docker or if you need an on-demand learning and test environment.

    2. :fontawesome-brands-docker: **Run a pre-built Container in your own Docker runtime environment.**
        - The best choice if you want the quickest lab setup experience and ideal if you already have Docker running in your development environment.

    3. :material-microsoft-visual-studio-code: **Use the Visual Studio Code Development Container in the [Git Repository](https://github.com/wwt/devasc-data-formats "DEVASC Data Formats Git Repository"){target=_blank}.**
        - The best choice if you want an easy environment to both run the lab and also to access or modify source files.

                A PowerShell script will customize the lab environment automatically although and you need to paste a long command into a PowerShell window to start that process:

                !!! tip
                    1. Click the PowerShell icon in the taskbar to open a new PowerShell window.
                    2. Then, copy the entire command below to your clipboard.
                    3. Right-click in the PowerShell window to paste the command
                    4. Press your ++enter++ or ++"Return"++ key to run the command.

                    - From time to time, the Windows desktop in this lab takes a lengthy amount of time to successfully start the Docker Desktop process and, rarely, Windows will fail to start Docker Desktop. If Windows cannot start Docker Desktop, your first indication will be an error message when you run the PowerShell script that configures the lab.

                        - As the PowerShell error message indicates, PowerShell will attempt to start or restart the Docker Desktop process. After a few seconds, the Docker Desktop application will open behind the PowerShell window, and you may bring it to the foreground to monitor the status.

Sometimes, Windows takes 5-10 minutes to start the Docker process.

                        - ==An orange-colored icon== in the lower-left corner of the Docker Desktop application indicates the Docker process is not running and you have a couple of options:

                            1. Wait for around 10 minutes to see if Windows can start the Docker process.
                            2. Launch a new instance of the [WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab](https://www.wwt.com/lab/programmability-foundations-lab "WWT Programmability Foundations On-Demand Lab"){target=_blank}.
